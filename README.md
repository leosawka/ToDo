# Repositorio base del Curso de Introducción a React.js en Platzi

Hello, fellow coder!
Welcome to the repository containing all the code from the Introduction to React.js Course. To get started, you should clone this repository (git clone), install its dependencies (npm i), and run the application (npm start).

The main branch has the code with which we start the course. In the other branches, you'll find the code for the subsequent lessons and, finally, the deployment of the application.

Good luck with your React learning journey! #NeverStopLearning

Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

For more information on deployment, see the section about deployment.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you’re not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it copies all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project, so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, so you can tweak them. From this point, you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
